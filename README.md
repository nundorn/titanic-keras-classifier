# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Keras + Deep Learning)

This project solves the Kaggle [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) challenge using a deep learning approach with **Keras**.  
The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on demographic and travel information.

## Features

- Preprocessing with missing value handling and label encoding
- Standardization with `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn
- Deep neural network built using Keras `Sequential` API
- Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- Validation split for model evaluation
- Submission-ready `CSV` file for Kaggle
